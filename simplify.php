<!--	<h3>How do we do it?</h3>
	<p>We use an operating system called Linux which is also used by companies like <b>Google</b>, <b>Amazon</b>, and <b>GoDaddy</b>. It is even what <b>Android</b> cellphones are built on. Linux is community made which means there are no copyrights or patents. So anyone is free to improve on it. Because it is always being updated, it is almost impossible to get viruses on it. Not to mention it is fully customizable. If there are things you don't like about your new setup, you can change it however you want. Linux is a free operating system, so the service we offer is to fully set up your computer so that you can start using it right away. If you are capable of setting it up yourself, feel free to!</p>-->
