  <h2>QUICK START GUIDE</h2>
  <h3>Welcome to your new Linux computer!</h3>
  <p>Here we have put together a few tips and tricks to help you get used to your new Linux computer. Please read through it and refer back to it for basic use of your system.</p>
  <a name='mydistro'></a><h3>My Distribution</h3>  
  <p>There are many versions, or distributions, of Linux. The one that we chose to put on your computer is called <a href='http://www.linuxmint.com/download_lmde.php' target='_blank'>Linux Mint Debian Edition</a> (LMDE). We chose it because it is very easy to use, and it is constantly being improved. The name of the distribution is important to know when you are trying to install certain programs. We'll explain more about that a later on though. <a href='#top'>[Top]</a></p>
 <a name='use'></a><h3>Basic Use</h3>
  <p>The layout you currently have works similarly to Windows. You have a applications menu and your open windows listed at the bottom as well as some other system information like your internet connection, volume, date and time, etc.</p>

  <p>In the <b>applications menu</b>, along the left side you have you power off  and log out buttons, as well as system settings, package manager and some favorites above them. If you hover your mouse over anything in the start menu it will give you a description of the item in the bottom right of the menu. <a href='#top'>[Top]</a></p>
  <a name='install'></a><h3>Installing Programs</h3>
  <img src='images/mint-software.png' width='350' align='right' />
  <p>Most of the programs that you need will are found right in Linux Mint's software manager. It can be opened from the applications menu on the left side, or in the Administration section of the menu. You can search for packages by typing in keywords at the top, or by clicking the category buttons. If you can't find what you are looking for, like Skype for instance, then try going to Skype's website. Skype and other well popular programs will be able to tell that you are using linux and they will give you the correct download file.</p> 
  <p>However, some programs might need a little more help. If you need help installing something, you can always search the internet how to install it. Make sure that you search how to install on <b>Debian</b> linux. You are using Linux Mint, but it is built on Debian and you will get better and more reliable results this way. <a href='#top'>[Top]</a></p>
  <a name='updates'></a><h3>Updates</h3>
  <img src='images/mint-updates.png' align='left' />
  <p>You might notice a small white sheild next to your sound, internet and notifications icons on the bottom right of your screen. The icon it for your system updates. Linux does a good job of maintaining just about every program that you install on your system, so it is important to update when you can. When the sheild has a blue circle on it, as pictured above, it means you have updates available. Click on the shield to review and install them. <a href='#top'>[Top]</a></p>
  <a name='users'></a><h3>User & Password Management</h3>
  <img src='images/mint-settings.jpg' width='300' align='left' style='padding:10px;' />
  <p>You should have been given your password to your new computer when you received it. If not, please contact us. You will need that password for a lot of tasks, like installing program and doing updates. If you would like to change your password or add more users you can do it by openning the applcations menu and finding System Settings on the left side or in the Administration category. Then scroll down to find User Accounts. Here, you can change your password to something easier for you to remember, just dont forget it! <a href='#top'>[Top]</a></p><br />
  <a name='else'></a><h3>Everything else...</h3>
  <p>For everything else please refer to the <b>User Guide</b> document on your computer desktop. For an online version, click <a href='http://www.linuxmint.com/documentation/user-guide/english_15.0.pdf' target='_blank'>here</a>. If it is not covered in there, then let us know, and we will find you a solution. Other than that, enjoy your Linux powered computer!! <a href='#top'>[Top]</a></p>
